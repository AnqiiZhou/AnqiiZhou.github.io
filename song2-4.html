First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah
I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don’t pay to lie cause I don’t wanna see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, I'mma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah
I'm going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
