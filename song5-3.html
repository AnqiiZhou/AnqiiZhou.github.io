Love Story – Taylor Swift (泰勒·斯威夫特)
Lyrics by：Taylor Swift
Composed by：Taylor Swift
Produced by：Nathan Chapman/Taylor Swift
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I’m standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don’t go
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I’ll be waiting all there’s left to do is run
You’ll be the prince and I’ll be the princess
It’s a love story baby just say yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet ’cause we’re dead if they knew
So close your eyes escape this town for a little while
‘Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don’t go
And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I’ll be waiting all there’s left to do is run
You’ll be the prince and I’ll be the princess
It’s a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me they’re trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it’s real
Don’t be afraid we’ll make it out of this mess
It’s a love story baby just say yes
Oh oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
Romeo save me I’ve been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I don’t know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet you’ll never have to be alone
I love you and that’s all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
It’s a love story baby just say yes
Oh oh
Oh oh
‘Cause we were both young when I first saw you
