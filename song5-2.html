I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor’s Version) – Taylor Swift
Lyrics by：Taylor Swift/Shellback/Max Martin
Composed by：Taylor Swift/Shellback/Max Martin
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble
No apologies he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning you're drowning you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see now I see now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me hey
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Oh
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Yeah
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh-oh
Yeah
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her or anyone or anything
Yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Never been
'Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Knew it right there
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Ooh
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh
Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
