Girl you don't know how I feel how I really feel
Since you been away oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call take my call
If I dialed you today oh
Girl you say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long hoping you pick up your phone
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby oh baby oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking heartbreaker
Girl you see me standing here standing here
Standing in the rain oh baby
Any chance you could stay right here yeah yeah
And never go away
Girl you say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long hoping you pick up your phone
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby oh baby oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking heartbreaker
So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal this just for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
And you know I don't wanna lose that cause I still believe
I still believe in love I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us the way I believe in us you don't see
Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak
I really don't sleep I wanna talk to you
And if I'd have the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you feeling the way that I'm the way that I'm
And you taught me to be careful with your heart your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart your heart with your heart
