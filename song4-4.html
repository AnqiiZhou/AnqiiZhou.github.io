Written by：Bruno Mars/Philip Lawrence/Ari Levine/Andrew Wyatt

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now

Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same

When our friends talk about you

All it does is just tear me down

'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

And it all just sounds like uh uh uh

Hmmm too young too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand

Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance

Take you to every party

'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing

But she's dancing with another man

My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways

'Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life

Now I'll never never get to clean up the mess I made

And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like uh uh uh uh

Too young too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand

Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance

Take you to every party

Cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing

But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong

Oh I know I'm probably much too late

To try and apologize for my mistakes

But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hand

Give you all his hours when he has the chance

Take you to every party

'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance

Do all the things I should have done when I was your man

Do all the things I should have done when I was your man
