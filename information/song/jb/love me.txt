My friends say I’m a fool to think

That you’re the one for me

I guess I’m just a sucker for love

‘Cuz honestly the truth is that

You know I’m never leavin’

‘Cuz you’re my angel sent from above

Baby you can do no wrong

My money is yours

Give you little more because I love ya, love ya

With me, girl, is where you belong

Just stay right here

I promise my dear I’ll put nothin above ya. above ya

Love me, Love me

Say that you love me

Fool me, Fool me

Oh how you do me

Kiss me, Kiss me

Say that you miss me

Tell me what I wanna hear

Tell me you (love me)

Love me, Love me

Say that you love me

Fool me, Fool me

Oh how you do me

Kiss me, Kiss me

Say that you miss me

Tell me what I wanna hear

Tell me u love me

People try to tell me

But I still refuse to listen

Cuz they don’t get to spend time with you

A minute with you is worth more than

A thousand days without your love, oh your love

Baby you can do no wrong

My money is yours

Give you little more because I love ya, love ya

With me, girl, is where you belong

Love Me

Just stay right here

I promise my dear I’ll put nothin above ya. above ya

Love me, Love me

Say that you love me

Fool me, Fool me

Oh how you do me

Kiss me , kiss me

Say that u miss me

Tell me what I wanna hear

Tell me you love me.

Love me, Love me

Say that you love me

Fool me, Fool me

Oh how you do me

Kiss me , kiss me

Say that u miss me

Tell me what I wanna hear

Tell me you love me.

My heart is blind but I don’t care

‘Cuz when I’m with you everything has disappeared

And every time I hold you near

I never wanna let you go, oh

Love me, Love me

Say that you love me

Fool me, Fool me

Oh how you do me

Kiss me , kiss me

Say that u miss me

Tell me what I wanna hear

Tell me you love me.

Love me, Love me

Say that you love me

Fool me, Fool me

Oh how you do me

Kiss me , kiss me

Say that u miss me

Tell me what I wanna hear

Tell me you love me
