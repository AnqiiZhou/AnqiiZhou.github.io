I got my peaches out in Georgia
Oh yeah s**t
I get my w**d from California
That’s that s**t
I took my chick up to the North yeah
Bada*s b***h
I get my light right from the source yeah
Yeah that’s it
And I say oh
Oh
The way I breathe you in
In
It’s the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you baby and never let you go
And I say oh
There’s nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up
Yeah and I’ll be right here with you till the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia
Oh yeah s**t
I get my w**d from California
That’s that s**t
I took my chick up to the North yeah
Bada*s b***h
I get my light right from the source yeah
Yeah that’s it
You ain’t sure yet
But I’m for ya
All I can want
All I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There’s no time I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa
I got my peaches out in Georgia
Oh yeah s**t
I get my w**d from California
That’s that s**t
I took my chick up to the North yeah
Bada*s b***h
I get my light right from the source yeah
Yeah that’s it
I get the feeling so I’m sure
Hand in my hand because I’m yours
I can’t I can’t pretend
I can’t ignore you’re right for me
Don’t think you wanna know just where I’ve been oh
Done bein’ distracted
The one I need is right in my arms
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I’ll be right here with you till the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia
Oh yeah s**t
I get my w**d from California
That’s that s**t
I took my chick up to the North yeah
Bada*s b***h
I get my light right from the source yeah
Yeah that’s it
I got my peaches out in Georgia
Oh yeah s**t
I get my w**d from California
That’s that s**t
I took my chick up to the North yeah
Bada*s b***h
I get my light right from the source yeah
Yeah that’s it
I got my peaches out in Georgia
Oh yeah s**t
I get my w**d from California
That’s that s**t
I took my chick up to the North yeah
Bada*s b***h
I get my light right from the source yeah
Yeah that’s it
I got my peaches out in Georgia
Oh yeah s**t
